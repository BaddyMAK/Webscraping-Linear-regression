This natural-leaning wine is a bit dichotomous. The nose starts off on rich aromas of citrus oil, drawn butter, smoke and walnut skin, while the palate is more tense and mineral driven. Crushed stone and steely lemon flavors are energetic and lifted, while drying tannins lend grip.

Aromas of scorched earth, toasted nut, burnt rubber and stewed prune form the nose. On the evolved palate, grainy tannins accompany dried cherry, prune, rusty nail and a hint of nutmeg before a lean, mouthdrying finish that grips the close. Despite the astringent tannins, drink sooner rather than later to capture what little fruit remains.
